# Elegoo Smart Car V4 Programming Course

Welcome to the Elegoo Smart Car V4 Programming Course repository, curated by Frederick Feraco. This course is designed to introduce students to the fascinating world of robotics and programming through hands-on experience with the Elegoo Smart Car V4. By using Python, one of the most versatile programming languages, students will learn how to control and extend the capabilities of the smart car, exploring concepts like object detection, face tracking, and gesture control.

## Objective

The primary goal of this course is to provide a comprehensive learning experience that combines theory with practical applications. Students will engage with a series of Jupyter Notebooks that progressively build their understanding and skills in robotics programming, computer vision, and network communication.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.x installed**: Make sure you have a Python 3.x environment set up. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **OpenCV and other dependencies**: This course requires OpenCV, NumPy, and Requests libraries. You can install these using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python-headless numpy requests
  ```
- **Elegoo Smart Car V4**: This course is designed specifically for the Elegoo Smart Car V4. Ensure your car is assembled and ready for programming.
- **Camera Setup**: A camera mounted on the Elegoo Smart Car, accessible through a stream URL.

## Course Content

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a different aspect of programming the Elegoo Smart Car V4:

1. **Introduction to Elegoo Smart Car Control**: Learn the basics of sending commands to control the car's movement.
2. **Object Detection Controlled Car**: Dive into computer vision with object detection to control car movements.
3. **Face Following Car**: Explore face detection techniques to make the car follow a person.
4. **Hand Gesture Controlled Car**: Implement hand gesture recognition to control the car's actions.

Each module is contained in its own Jupyter Notebook, providing a mix of instructional content, code examples, and exercises.

## Getting Started

To begin the course, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Elegoo-Smart-Car-V4-Course.git
```

Navigate to the repository directory and start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
cd Elegoo-Smart-Car-V4-Course
jupyter notebook
```

Open the first notebook in the series and follow the instructions contained within.
